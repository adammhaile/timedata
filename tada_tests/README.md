Test code for tada
=============

This directory contains only Python scripts to test the _tada_ Python extension.

The great majority of the source is C++ and Cython code contained in the
top-level `src/tada` directory.

The build process will also move a `tada.so` file into this directory so
you can directly `import tada` from here.
